# ViewModel Refactoring with DynamicObject

This project demonstrates the refactoring of ViewModels using DynamicObject in C#, aiming to adapt code to evolving requirements and improve maintainability in large-scale project development.

## Purpose

In the development of large projects, the need often arises to continually expand and modify ViewModels to accommodate changing business requirements and UI enhancements. The purpose of this refactoring is to provide a flexible solution that automates upgrades and enhances code maintainability. This approach also lays the groundwork for future developments, such as utilizing generative AI for code generation and testing, to further improve development efficiency and code quality.

## Problem

As projects evolve, enforcing a uniform approach to UI becomes challenging, leading to ViewModel properties growing continuously and making the code difficult to manage and update. Key issues include:
1. Managing ViewModel properties effectively as the UI expands.
2. Handling continuous changes in UI data sources and the difficulties brought by property updates.
3. Maintaining code readability and maintainability as the project evolves.

## Solution

The solution proposed involves refactoring ViewModels using the DynamicObject class in C#. By inheriting from DynamicViewModel and utilizing the SetDynamicProperty method, ViewModel properties can be dynamically updated, thus automatically adapting to UI changes and expansions. This approach enables dynamic addition and updating of properties without altering the existing code structure, resulting in better management of UI changes.

## Before Refactoring

The code before refactoring required separate declaration of each data source property for the UI, leading to cumbersome and difficult-to-maintain code.

## After Refactoring

After refactoring, the code becomes clearer and easier to maintain. With the use of DynamicObject, properties can be dynamically added and updated as needed, better addressing UI expansions and changes.

## Non-applicable Scenarios

While using DynamicObject simplifies ViewModel design and management, it may not be suitable for all scenarios. Cases requiring static type checking and high performance may not be ideal for dynamic types.

## Conclusion

Refactoring ViewModels using DynamicObject improves code flexibility and maintainability, facilitating better adaptation to UI changes and expansions. This approach is suitable for projects requiring continual upgrades and modifications during development and provides a foundation for future advancements, such as leveraging generative AI for code generation and testing.
